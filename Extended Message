Added core project files:
- app.py: Main Streamlit application with GPT-4 integration
- .env: Environment configuration template for API keys
- README.md: Project documentation and setup instructions
- requirements.txt: List of dependencies needed to run the application
- SETUP_NOTES.md: Important notes about API keys and configuration

This chatbot application uses Streamlit for the user interface, LangChain for conversation memory management, and OpenAI's GPT-4 for generating responses. The app features a clean interface with conversation history and context awareness.

NOTE: Users must create their own .env file with their OpenAI API key (OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here) for the application to function properly.
